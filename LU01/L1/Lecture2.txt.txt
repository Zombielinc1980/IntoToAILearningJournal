Unit 1 Lecture 2 - AI Terms

Algorithm: A set of rules that a machine can follow to learn how to do a task.

Artificial intelligence: This refers to the general concept of machines acting in a way that simulates or mimics 
human intelligence. AI can have a variety of features, such as human-like communication or decision making.

Bias: An assumption made by a model that simplify the process of learning to do its assigned task.

Big Data: Datasets that are too large or complex to be used by traditional data processing applications

Black Box: A system whose internal workings are opaque, meaning its decision-making process is not transparent and cannot be understood by humans

Context Window: is the maximum number of tokens (words or parts of the word) that an AI model can process and consider simultaneously when generating a response.

Emergent Behavior: The unexpected skills of AI that we didn't train it to do.

Generative AI: A prompt is giving and it gives a response related to it.

Hallucination: Making something up when it doesn't have a factual response.

Large Language Model (LLM): This is what generative AI uses to forecast its sequences.

Meta Prompt/System Prompt: The set of instructions given to the AI behind the scenes before an interaction begins.

Prompt Engineering: Perfecting your prompts to help make more effective outputs from the AI model's outputs.

Temperature (AI Temperature): Setting controls how deterministic or creative that AI model's output is Lower values (e.g., 0.2) lead to more focused and consistent answers.

Token: Common sequences of characters found in a set of text.
