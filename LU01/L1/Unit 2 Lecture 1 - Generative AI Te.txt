Unit 2 Lecture 1 - Generative AI Text

Prompt Engineering - How can I get AI to do what I want as efficiently as possible with the shortest prompt possible.

Prompt - A natural language text the requests the generative AI to perform a specific task.

Prompts are important because it improves user experience, increases flexibility and can be much cheaper.

Give clear and specific prompts to get better results from generative AI.

Prompt Steps:
- Task: 
	Persona (Who the AI is)
	Format: Output Style
- Context: 
	Good: Give me some ideas for a birthday present. Under $30
	Great: Give me 5 ideas for a birthday present. My budget is $30. 
	The gift is for a 29 year old who loves winter sports and has recently switched to snowboarding from skiing.
- Reference:
	Additional input data, ideas
- Evaluate:
	"Is it a good _?", Does it meet the requirements I provided?
- Iterate
	Go back through with the AI to fix any possible errors with your prompt or results of the prompt and make changes
	where they are needed.

Summarize the key data points and information in this report. Then create visual graphs from the data, and shorten
the key information into bullets.

AI can sometimes get stuck with your prompt if its not worded correctly and you might keep getting the same errors when it
comes to coding prompts. You can try writing the same thing just in a different way or you can go to a different generative
AI to see if it can help resolve your issue.

Introducing constraints on your prompts can help create better results more tailored to you.
