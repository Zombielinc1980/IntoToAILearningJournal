Unit 1 Lecture 1 - What is AI? It is defined as a computer system that
can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision
making, creating, etc. AI also stands for Artificial Intelligence. There
is no single definition of Artificial Intelligence. A machine is said to
have artificial intelligence to interpret data and learn and adapt to
the new data. This also allows people to recognize the machine as AI.
Not every machine is referred to as a robot but referred to as what the
machine is if it works (ex. Washing Machine or Dish Washer). Your phone
camera processor is way smaller than regular cameras. AI can be found in
other things like rice cookers to cook your rice perfectly since the
90s. The definition can be just about any computer program processing
variables for an output of the source. AI may be become a \"bubble\" of
the internet.
