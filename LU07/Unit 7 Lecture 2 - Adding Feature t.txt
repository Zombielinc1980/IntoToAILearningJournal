Unit 7 Lecture 2 - Adding Feature to Svelte

You can use AI to create a project or just run a command to create it

Created a website using the prompt given to us for class: 
Create a simple page that displays the event name

-Event Name "Iowa Tech Summit"
-Description: "Connect, Learn, and Grow at Iowas Premier Technology Conference"
Date: September 15, 2026
Time: 10:00 AM
Location: Iowa Events Center

Style it nicely with Tailwind CSS. Make the event name Blue and Bold

It created a register and learn more button despite me not asking for it

I gave the register button a function

Added a photo of my cat to the website to test if it can properly add images

Asked it to add a second event and it completely made up a new event that doesn't exist
